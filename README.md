Zach Bruggeman's website.

### Editing

This iteration of this site was designed in [Monodraw](http://monodraw.helftone.com/), an awesome ASCII art editor. I've included the Monodraw project for this site in the `assets/` folder. The layers are a bit messy, but play around with it if you feel like.
